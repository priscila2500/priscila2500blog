I hate wordpress.

I've wanted to make a blog since forever, and I've tried to build and mantain wordpress blogs several times.

*It is. such. a pain.*

To be fair I'm not sure if wordpress has changed much in the last 5 years or so. I'm new to building static web pages. I hope I stick with this!

This is a test post and I might delete later.
