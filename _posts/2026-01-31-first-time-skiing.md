I went to ski for the first time with High Park Ski Club (HPSC) on Jan 17, 2026. It was interesting because it was a day full of first time experiences.

Why am I skiing now? Well, even though I've been living in Toronto, ON, for about 14 years I've never tried it before. I figured that if I'm going to commit to living in Canada in the long term it would be best to pick a winter sport, something to do that would take me outdoors during the long and dark winter months. 

I hadn't tried skiing before because of the high cost of ski clothing, transportation, rental equipment etc.  There also seems to be the perception in my Mexican circles that ski injuries are common; it seems that everyone has an story of someone they know that got injured skiing. It seemed to be a dangerous sport for rich people. So why now?

I think reading the Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin last July made me curious about skiing. If you havent heard of it, it's a sci-fi novel with a romance adjacent plot where two individuals of different species flee a prison camp and traverse 800 miles of snow and ice in skis, an ardous journey that challenges the limits of their cooperation and allows them to reach mutual understanding. I haven't read anything I have adored as much in a long time so I credit this book with building positive ski associations in my head. 

And so I signed up with HPSC and booked this first trip to Mount St Louis. It was my first time at Mount St Louis. It was my first time wearing ski clothes, wearing ski rentals and taking a beginners ski class. It was my first time being around crazy snowboarders. 

It was a great experience! I enjoyed myself and was better at it that I dared hope. We had the beginner class in the morning, curtesy of HPSC instructors, where I couldn't control my speed down on the bunny hill and crashed several time into others. I fell in the snow at low speed once or twice. The highlight of my day was going up the magic carpet to a steeper incline bunny hill were I freaked out. This was after lunch and I was already tired and I thought there was no way I could go down the slope without falling face first into the snow, my snowplow was just not being reliable enough yet. What happaned after was amazing, one of the HPSC instructors, Pat, told me I could do it and that she would go down the hill right next to me and what followed was that I was able to go down the hill perfectly fine at a slow speed, Pat sliding down next to me. It made me crazy with laugher that I managed to do it on my own! 

The skiing went fine and I would do it again. I was very tired the next day and my calves were sore the next two days but it was so worth it.
