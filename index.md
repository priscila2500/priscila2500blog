## Hello!

**I am a healthcare researcher from Mexico living in Toronto, ON, Canada.**

And now I have a blog! This blog is mostly meant to aid my conversations with friends and family. At times I will start to go on and on about a topic to cut myself short because well, now I have the good sense to know that *the listening party might not be interested*. And then I'll think, as a follow-up on this topic,maybe I could *give them a link?*
